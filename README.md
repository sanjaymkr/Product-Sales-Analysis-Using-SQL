# Product-Sales-Analysis-Using-SQL

## Overview
The data contains three years worth of sales data of different product lines across different countries. The aim of this project is to understand the overall sales performance of this company (let’s call it Moveit Limited).

## Problem Statement
Moveit Ltd has been in operations for a little over 2 years and they want to understand the following:

1. Across all their product line, which one is the best selling?
2. What was the best year for sales?
3. What was the best month for sales?
4. Which country sold the most product?
5. Who is the best customer?

## Data Visualization

For better understanding of the data analysis, I made use of Tableau to create a user-friendly interactive dashboard. This dashboard is a brief visual summary of the report on this data.
